# Interrogate

Adversaries try to break a change or a design. A finding survives only when a run proves it. Report the findings. Do not apply fixes.

Native effort comes from the configured role selector. Service tier comes only from `task.agentServiceTierOverrides[name]` over `tier.subagent`, with inheritance taking the live parent `/fast` state. Do not add model, effort, or speed fields to task items or mutate shared configuration. Include repository privacy and domain constraints in every child brief. Host safety and permissions remain authoritative.

## Frame

The scope is what the user names. Otherwise it is the branch diff from its merge base with the base branch, through the working tree. State the intent with the **in-your-own-words** skill, from the user's message, the commits, and the PR description. Ask the user when the intent is still unclear after reading that evidence.

## Fan out

Run Phase A steps 3 and 4 and Phase B of the **arena** skill, with three changes. Use the `interrogate reviewers` panel in place of `arena runners`, so each adversary registers with scalar `role: "interrogate reviewers"` and its zero-based `panelIndex`. Give each adversary's isolated workspace the scope's uncommitted changes. Native isolation captures the parent checkout's uncommitted changes as the workspace baseline. When the scope's working tree is another checkout, put its uncommitted diff in the brief for the adversary to apply first. In place of the arena task and rationale, give each adversary the scope, the intent, and this brief:

> Break this change. Prove each finding with a run against the real code, such as a failing test, a repro script, or command output that shows the wrong behavior. For a design or plan, run a prototype or probe the current tree. Keep repros in your own isolated workspace. Report each finding with a title, the exact command, the output it printed, and the output the intent requires. Leave out anything you did not run. That covers style, naming, structure, and risks that need a future change to matter. No findings is a valid result.

## Verify

Verify each finding per arena Phase F by rerunning its command. An adversary's repros return in its patch or branch artifact. Apply that artifact in a disposable checkout of the scope, never on the user's branch, and rerun there. Keep a finding when the output shows the failure and the failure breaks the intent. Drop the rest. Merge findings that share a root cause. Remove the disposable checkouts afterward.

Skip arena Phases C, D, and E. Adversaries find different failures, so the verdict keeps every verified finding, not one adversary's list.

## Output

- **Intent**: the restatement.
- **Findings**: for each verified finding, the command, its output, how it breaks the intent, and the adversaries that found it. Say "no verified findings" when none survive.
- **Dropped**: for each adversary, the count of dropped findings and why.
