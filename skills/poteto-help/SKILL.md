# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md), do the work under it, and mention once that native main-session mode stays on until explicitly turned off.

This file maps questions to the skills and guide pages that hold the answers. Those files own the details. Read the file you route to before you quote it, and trust it when it disagrees with this map. The links here point into the installed native package. Cite the actual installed file or `skill://<name>` URI for OMP-specific advice. The author's public copy at `https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack` documents upstream behavior, not proof of this native port's tools or setup.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- Read the file at the effective `configurationPath` reported by `/pstack status` and native model-role settings when setup or cost matters. Missing configuration is a named prerequisite, not a reason to invent defaults or silently substitute a model.
- No `verify-*` skill or other app harness in the project means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.

When the native role table is missing and it matters, ask whether the user wants to pick a model for each role and a reasoning budget now. It matters when the user is new, the question is about setup or cost, or the answer depends on which models run. Ask at most once per chat. If the need is also unclear, ask both questions together. Offer two choices:

- Now: give them `/setup-pstack` to type, and answer their question too.
- Later: answer their question, and state which configuration prerequisite remains before helper dispatch can work.

## Get set up

1. Check `omp plugin list --json` for the enabled native `pstack` package and confirm runtime skill, agent, and canonical extension discovery in a fresh session. Follow the native [setup guide](../../docs/guide/01-setup.md) when missing. Use `omp plugin install github:keylbill/pstack-omp#main` for installation and native `enable`/`disable` for availability; do not add standalone extension or individual discovery links. Cursor `/add-plugin` does not install this OMP extension. Use `omp plugin upgrade pstack` for the recorded Git ref. Local links cannot use native upgrade. Update OMP itself independently.
2. Run [`/setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md). It confirms the reasoning budget and native role mapping in the user-owned `models.json`. Native model assignments stay in OMP `modelRoles`. A stored budget alone never changes effort.
3. Start a real task with `/poteto-mode`, a goal, and a check that can pass or fail.

The native extension defaults fresh main sessions to mode on. Workers remain off unless explicitly invoked or given the delegate profile. `/pstack off` persists for that session. `/pstack update check` checks upstream and `/pstack update` invokes the native staged-update workflow, with its approval and promotion gates. The [README](../../README.md) and [guide page 1](../../docs/guide/01-setup.md) have the details. Offer to word their first prompt with them, per [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md).

If cost is the worry, say where the tokens go and how to spend fewer. pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. Rerun `/setup-pstack` and pick a smaller budget or cheaper models. A role set to `auto` or `inherit-parent` resolves to native `@default` through the planned helper hook. It follows the parent model rather than choosing a cheaper model automatically. A shorter panel list runs fewer subagents, one for each entry. Use `/pstack off` for turns that do not need the workflow. Role, family, effort, panel, and tier changes remain explicit user choices.

This package is the native OMP port. It uses `pstack_plan`, native `task` workers, and `pstack_schedule`, not Cursor task fields, cloud machines, Custom Modes, or `/loop`. Read [native execution](../poteto-mode/references/omp-runtime.md) before explaining dispatch, history, model roles, speed, or scheduling.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one. [Guide page 2](../../docs/guide/02-poteto-mode.md) has examples.

Native `/poteto-mode` enables persistent mode in the main session and invokes the full router. Fresh main sessions default on. `/pstack off` opts out for the current session, and `/pstack status` reports the state. `/skill:poteto-mode` is the native skill invocation alternative. Do not describe Cursor Enter, Option+Enter, or Custom Modes as OMP controls.

Mid-chat, "new task" matches a fresh playbook. The receiving chat runs it. Its scoped engineering delegates use `agent: "poteto-agent"` after exact-name `pstack_plan` registration. Give each delegate the router's absolute path from the actual invocation. Never delegate the whole coordinator playbook to that profile.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

| The user wants to | Skill |
|---|---|
| Do any non-trivial task with rigor | [`/poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) |
| Check that the agent understood their goal and the problem before it starts | [`/in-your-own-words`](../in-your-own-words/SKILL.md) |

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- `deslop`, `control-cli`, and `control-ui` are installed OMP capabilities. Read their `skill://` instructions before use.
- `/loop` is not a native OMP command. Use `pstack_schedule` for a main-session heartbeat. `create-skill` is an installed OMP capability.
- pstack has no `/orchestrate` skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. If the slash menu shows `/orchestrate`, another plugin provides it.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

When native mode is off, explicitly invoke `/poteto-mode` to select these playbooks instead of relying on a similarly named host workflow. The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists every playbook and when it applies. [Guide page 6](../../docs/guide/06-verify-and-ship.md) covers opening, babysitting, and landing a PR.

pstack has no standalone planning skill. Native OMP planning and model roles remain host-owned. For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." Typing `/principle-<name>` still loads one on demand. [Guide page 8](../../docs/guide/08-principles.md) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | Read `/pstack status`. `/pstack on` or `/poteto-mode` enables this main session. Respect an explicit `/pstack off`. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | Inspect `models.json`, native `modelRoles`, and helper registrations. Fresh planned spawns read the current table. Check actual child resolved model and effort. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill did not load | Check native discovery with `skill://<name>` or `/skill:<name>`. The extension also enumerates unprefixed aliases. Mode routes only the skills the task needs. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Give each writer exclusive paths or use `isolated: true`. Integrate isolated patches deliberately. Never share a runtime or browser between writers. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | A `pstack_schedule` wake needs a check that can pass or fail, not a duration. Schedules are live-process-only and must be restarted after a process restart. See [guide page 7](../../docs/guide/07-overnight.md). |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers. [Guide page 10](../../docs/guide/10-recipes-and-pitfalls.md) has more pitfalls and the recipes worth copying.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

[Guide page 9](../../docs/guide/09-make-it-yours.md) covers each of these.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
